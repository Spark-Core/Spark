## Contributing to Spark

We want to make it easy for you to help with developing, we just want to make sure of a few things.

1. All code is examined using eslint (`npm install eslint && eslint .`), using our configuration file included inside of the repository.
2. Malicious code is not allowed, deliberately adding bugs or causing (parts of) the framework to crash.
3. All code submitted must be "beautified" before posting, if you want to keep it simple, just use [this one](http://jsbeautifier.org)
4. Make pull requests to the Updates branch. No pull requests should be made for the master branch unless it's a major release.

## Submitting a new issue

Before submitting a new issue:

- Search the issues to see if your issue hasn't been added before, (and if it has a fix already.)
- No issues about external modules used for commands etc., we will only look at the issue if the cause of the issue lies within the framework's code. Contact the developer that made the module for more information.
- No issues asking us for help on how to set up a bot. You can find info about how to set a bot up on our website. If the website is not clear enough, create an issue and tell us what should be made easier to understand for other users.
- Don't add "me 2" or something like that in the commands. You can react with :thumbsup: on the initial issue to show us.
